1.Navigate to the Backend Folder:

Go to the backend folder in the project directory:

cd backend
Install Dependencies:
npm install
Start the Backend Server:

Start the backend server using:
node server.js
The backend will now be running at http://localhost:5000.

2.Set Up the Frontend
Navigate to the Frontend Folder:

cd ../frontend
Open the Frontend in a Browser:

Open the index.html file in your web browser. You can either:

Double-click the index.html file to open it in your default browser.
Use a local server to serve the HTML file if needed (for example, use the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code).
4. Features
The User Registration App includes the following features:

CRUD Operations:

Create: Add new users by entering their name, email, and date of birth.
Read: View all registered users in a table.
Update: Edit user details (name, email, and date of birth).
Delete: Remove a user from the list.
Responsive Interface: The application adapts to various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.

5. API Endpoints
The backend provides the following API endpoints for CRUD operations:

GET /api/users - Retrieve a list of all users.
POST /api/users - Add a new user (requires name, email, and dateOfBirth in the request body).
PUT /api/users/:id - Update an existing user's details (requires name, email, and dateOfBirth in the request body).
DELETE /api/users/:id - Delete a user by their ID.
6. How It Works
Frontend:

The frontend communicates with the backend via AJAX requests (using fetch()).
It allows users to add, update, and delete user records.
The user data is displayed in a table, with buttons to edit or delete users.
Backend:

The backend is built using Node.js and Express.
User data is stored in-memory in a simple array (users).
The backend exposes RESTful endpoints to handle CRUD operations on the user data.
